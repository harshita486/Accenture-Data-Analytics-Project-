Project Background:
Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate, aiming to create a platform that emphasizes content and user reactions. With over 500 million active users each month, the company has experienced rapid growth and requires external expertise to manage its scaling process effectively.

Key Objectives:
IPO Preparation: Guidance to ensure a smooth initial public offering (IPO) by the end of next year.
Resource Management: Assistance in managing current scaling challenges without solely relying on hiring additional staff.
Data Best Practices: Learning from established companies on managing and analyzing extensive unstructured data.
